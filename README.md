# Clean Code – Uncle Bob / Lesson 1 Summary

Uncle Bob starts by camparing the knowledge we knew about the sun 2500 years ago which was alittle although it was everywhere and we were benifiting from it, and how we've mastered it nowadays by displine and science. That related to softwares nowadays that are everywhere; We dont just have to focus in making it work, we have a responsibility to make it clean, reliable and written with ethics in mind.

He then talks about clean code and how making the code works in only half of the process, the other part is making it clean. You should not focus on writing code that the computer understands, but the other developers understands! You're coding fast when you're coding clean!

Then he talks about good code which is a code that explains itself by it's structure and logic and not the comments that explains it, and the polite code wich respects the people working on the code after you.

After that he dives into shrunk code, functions should be small- really small. A function body should match it's name, hence it should only do one thing. Prose code principle adds to the shrunk code principle to say that the function should not have more than three arguments or an boolean argument because that is an indication that the funtion is doing more than one thing. He then says that you should avoid switch case statements cause they voilate the open-closed principle which states that the code should be open for extension closed for modification, and hence you should use oop and polymorphism instead of switch statements.

Later, he talks about side effects which happens when a function does something unexpected for  some unexpected reason, so you have to use exceptions and try-catch to handle that. Afterward, he talked about the don't repeat yourself principle which states that no logic should be repeated in your code even if your using it twice.

Finally, Uncle Bob talks about the foundation of structured programming, which goes back to the idea that code should have a clear, organized flow. Structured programming was a major shift in how developers wrote software — focusing on readability, logic, and structure instead of clever tricks or spaghetti code.
